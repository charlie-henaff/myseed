# Concept
>Every time I go onto Spotify to listen music I tell me this : It's always the same songs...  
>Yes Spotify know my tastes but sometime I just want to discover new things

- Why Spotify always show me same music ?
    - Cause they know that I like these musics
- Why Spotify know my music taste ?
    - Cause I give it to them
- Why they want me to like the played music ?
    - Cause if y I like music I'll stay on the app
- Why I'll like a music ?
    - Cause it remembers me a good moment
    - Cause lyrics speack to me
    - Cause I like the vibes

So let's try to create an app that offers new music that users do not know, but that can refer to good times, lyrics that speak to them or musical vibrations liked.
